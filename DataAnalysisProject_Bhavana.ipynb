    "Task 1: Data collection\n",
    "1. Written a Python script to download data from the Internet.\n",
    "2. Ensure that the downloaded data is sufficient for meaningful data analysis in future projects while avoiding excessive data volume for MongoDB upload.\n",
    "3. Provided information about the data source, including its origin, structure, time frame, and size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Task 2: Write JSON data to MongoDB\n",
    "1. Write the collected data to a MongoDB Atlas collection.\n",
    "2. Validate the correctness of data insertion into MongoDB.\n",
    "3. Save all data to a local text file in valid JSON format for reference and backup."
